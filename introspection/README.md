INTROSPECTION 
 
Why must we choose you?
          
         
      First of all I love learning something new and am pretty excited to work on what all i have learnt. The next thing is ,i believe that just a bookish form of learning ain't enough and our skills will improve if and only if we use the knowledge to develop something. So I strongly feel amFoss can aid me in that .But if you ask me about my experience in coding or programming , i dont have a better answer, i would say am just a beginner and have a small experience which i gained by doing the tasks.
         
        I was a biology student back in 11th and 12th grade (that happened because i failed to recognize my interests at that time),which made me feel that the tasks are not for me but somehow i started doing it.I really tried my very best and i spent much time to learn and complete the tasks. So I seriously wish to get selected    

What is your plan for the next 6 months?
             
              I wish to polish my skills and learn new things 
   
How would you contribute back to the club?    
           
              
          Active participation in the club events .Also i would like to be a part of anything which aids in the development of the club  
                                          

Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
                 

        I would say that the tasks are really challenging for me. I shifted from biology to computer science so it actually helped me in gaining knowledge about the subject. One thing i felt is that, people who have learnt computer science are at an advantage so it creates a small difference
